== What's LPprof ?

Lpprof combines Linux-tools perf record and perf stat commands on parallel processes.
It analyzes perf record samples and perf stat results to provide an HPC oriented performance summary.

== Obtaining, Building and Installating LPprof

LPprof's code is available at GitHub https://github.com/edf-hpc/lpprof[https://github.com/edf-hpc/lpprof].
You can clone it using *git*:

 $ git clone https://github.com/edf-hpc/lpprof.git

Debian packaging files are included, so if you are using a Debian or a Debian derivative system you only need to build a Debian package and install it. Before building the package, you need to install the following packages:

 $ apt-get install debhelper dh-python python3-all python3-setuptools pandoc dpkg-dev

If you are not using Debian, Lpprof provides a setuptools script for its installation.
Just run:

 $ python setup.py install


== Profiling with LPprof

=== Commands

Monoprocessus profiling:

 $ lpprof --frequency=<sampling_frequency(Hz)> <exe>

Profile a process given its PID (or a list of processes by giving a list of their pids):

 $ lpprof --frequency=<sampling_frequency(Hz)> --pids <pid1,pid2,...> <exe>

Profile a program executed with a parallel launcher (ex: srun):

 $ lpprof --launcher=<launcher> --frequency=<sampling_frequency(Hz)> <exe>


=== Results

LPprof makes a PERF_<date> directory that contains the following files at the end of the run :

 perf_data.<rank> (perf record output)
 perf_stat.<rank> (perf stat output)
 LPprof_perf_report (lpprof performance report)

== Lpprof performance report

Lpprof performance report provides the following metrics. For each metric minimum, maximum and average values across ranks
are given with associated rank numbers.

*hwc counter metrics:*

Hardware counters like cycles or cpu-clock and metrics derived from hardware counters like instructions per cycle or cycles spent due to TLBmiss
which is computed as the following ratio :

  (ITLB_MISSES.WALK_DURATION + DTLB_MISSES.WALK_DURATION)*100 / cycles

Theses counters are available on modern Intel CPU at least from Sandy-Bridge to Kaby-Lake architectures.

*vectorization metrics:*

SSE, AVX and AVX2 proportion are computed from assembly instructions samples. Only double precision operations are taken into account.


*asm metrics:*

Most frequently used assembly instructions (top 95%).
Assembly instructions that are reported correspond to instruction pointer addresses found in perf samples.

*sym metrics:*

Most frequently used symbols (top 95%) found in samples collected with perf record.


== LPprof Slurm Spank Plugin

The Slurm Spank plugin:

  srun --lpprof_f=<frequency>

It is possible to profile only certain ranks by giving a list of ranks to profile:

  srun --lpprof_f=<frequency> --lpprof_r=<ranks>

Example for a profiling at 99Hz of ranks 0,7,8,9:

  srun --lpprof_f=99 --lpprof_r=0,7-9
